# Hey there 👋

Hello! My name is Berk Selvi and I am a full-stack web developer specializing in backend and interested in data science. I am currently studying Computer Science at Namık Kemal University and I am also developing side projects that solves real-world problems, and I love doing that!

Over the past three years, I've built websites for my clients as a freelance developer. When I started university, I trained myself with theoretical knowledge from various sources such as MIT and Stanford. After believing that I was at a sufficient level, I started to develop complex projects like [full-stack social media app](https://github.com/berkslv/social-media-app) and [C multithread web server](https://github.com/berkslv/c-web-server)

Having a vision from long and varied work experience, I have acquired skills such as responsibility, team player, time management and problem solving. I am confident that my vision and soft skills will help me in projects that I will develop alone or as a team member.
